it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences hsaC1 and emeN3 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file scfm_ungap.fa.reduced
