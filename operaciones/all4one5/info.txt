Esto solo son resultados de prueba de HMMER con diferentes opciones de filtros.

-E: In the per-target output, report target sequences with anE-value of<=<x>. The default is 10.0, meaning that onaverage, about 10 false positives will be reported per query,so you can see the top of the noise and decide for yourself if itâ€™s really noise.

-T: Instead of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a bit score of>=<x>.

--domE: In the per-domain output, for target sequences that have already satisfied the per-profile reporting threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of<=<x>. The default is10.0. A conditional E-value means the expected number of additional false positive domains in the smaller search space of those comparisons that already satisfied theper-target reporting threshold (and thus must have at leastone homologous domain already).

--domT: Instead of thresholding per-domain output on E-value, in-stead report domains with a bit score of>=<x>.
